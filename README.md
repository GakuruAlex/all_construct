# All Construct #

 A program that finds all the ways a target can be constructed by concatenating str from a given list. It returns a 2D list each element representing a combination that can construct the target. A word from the given list maybe reused more than once.

Example all_construct(purple, [purp, p, ur, le, purpl]) returns [[purp, le], [p, ur, p, le]]
